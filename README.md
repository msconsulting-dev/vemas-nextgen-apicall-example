# Vemas.NextGen API example

In this example we demonstrate how you can access the Vemas.NextGen-API from a plain JavaScript project.

We have two use cases covered for you, separated into own tabs:
* Calling an existing endpoint of Vemas.NextGen (adding an address)
*  Calling a new endpoint created by an API plugin

Besides that we provide the showcase plugin of Vemas.Inside under `/plugin`

### **Note:**

This example only demonstrates via code the possibility to get/pass data from/to our API.
The plugin itself is not a working example!
